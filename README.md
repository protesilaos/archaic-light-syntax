# Archaic syntax theme (light version)

Medium-to-high contrast syntax theme that draws inspiration from ancient wall paintings. Its palette consists of colours with an 'earthly' feel. The most prevalent accent values are variants of deep orange, amber, orange, green, and dark magenta.

*Archaic* comes in standalone light and dark versions (see further info below).

*JavaScript demo is source code of [prismjs](http://prismjs.com/)*  
*The UI is my experimental fork of the default One Dark*.
